    <h3 style=" margin-bottom: 15px;">Introduction</h3><p>
    The <b>World Happiness Report</b> is a publication that is 
    published annually by Sustainable Development Solutions Network, 
    powered by the Gallup World Poll data. It shows a ranking of countries by their happiness score, 
    which is determined by a number of factors. The factors are <b>GDP per capita</b>, 
    <b>social support</b>, <b>healthy life expectancy</b>, <b>freedom</b>, <b>generosity</b>, and <b>corruption</b>.
    In order to understand the factors that affect the happiness score, I have created a visualization that shows the relationship between different factors and the happiness score. Let's take a look at the visualization below.</p>

    <h3> Happiness Score in Each Country </h3>

            <p style="text-align: center;"><i>Figure 1 shows happiness score of countries</i></p>
    </div>
    <div class="row2"><p>
        From figure 1 we can see that happiness score around <b>South America, West America, Oceania and Europe</b> are generally higher.
    For <b>Asia and Africa</b>, happines score for both of them are generally lower than other continents.
Across the year from 2015 to 2019, we can observe that the happiness score for all of the countries has been dropping.</p></div>

            <h3 style="margin-bottom: 15px;">Trends of Scores by Country</h3><p>
            For scores of each aspect for Denmark, family, health and freedom are the top 3 highest scores.
            Generosity and corruption are the lowest scores. The high score attributes indicates that the country is doing well in that aspect.
            By switching to Afghanistan, we can see that the scores for each aspect are generally lower than Denmark.
            For Afghanistan, the lowest score attributes are family, health and freedom. The high score attributes are generosity and corruption.

        <h3>Correlation Betwwen Aspects</h3><br>

</div>

<div class="row2"><p>
    According to figure 3, we can observe that <b>high generosity of people and trust in government</b> usually correlates with with <b>more freedom to make choices</b> for a country.
    And <b>high GDP per Capita</b> usually correlates with <b>higher trust in government and generosity of people </b> for a country.
    We can deduce that the more generous the people are, the more trust they have in the government. And the more trust they have in the government, the more freedom they have.

        <h3 style="margin-bottom: 10px;">Relation Between Health, GDP and Freedom</h3><p style=" margin-left: 30px; margin-right: 30px;">
        Based on figure 4, we can see that there is a positive correlation between health and GDP and freedom.
        As the freedom and GDP increases, the health score also increases. This indicates that a country with more freedom and higher GDP is able to provide better healthcare for its citizens.
        Hence, we can deduce that greater freedom and GDP will lead to a healthier life.
